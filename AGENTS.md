# CityOS repository agent instructions: cityos-desigma

## CityOS repository federation

Before changing behavior, identify its registered source owner. This checkout is an independent source home; directory names, sibling checkouts, migration copies, generated projections, or dependencies do not transfer ownership. The target boundaries below guide placement, while current owner records govern actual transfers:

- `dakkah-cityos-cms` is the legacy transition donor. CMS domain/backend work targets `cityos-core-cms`; Engineering services and compiler backends target `cityos-engineering`; shared.policy targets `cityos-shared-policy`; Agora behavior stays in `cityos-core-agora`.
- `cityos-core-nexus` is Go-first. Tryton vendor integration remains Python. `cityos-zen` is the upstream-connected fork-maintenance repository; `cityos-shared-policy` consumes Zen as a pinned `vendor/zen` submodule and keeps CityOS extensions outside upstream-owned paths.
- Backend behavior uses Rust, Go, Python, or the required vendor runtime according to the owning system. CMS and Agora may be Rust-first, with Go/Python integrations where needed. TypeScript remains for web/front-end clients; do not add TypeScript backend business logic unless a current owner decision explicitly permits it during migration.

Keep existing CMS behavior until its owner-specific transfer, contract parity, migration/reconciliation, consumer adoption, rollback, and cutover evidence are complete. Target direction alone transfers no source authority or authorizes deletion, activation, or cutover. For cross-repository work, edit each owning repository and use versioned artifacts; do not rely on mutable sibling checkouts. Preserve independent Git histories and unrelated work.
